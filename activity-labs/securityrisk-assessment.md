#  Security risk assessment report 

## Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

Three hardening tools the organization can use to address the vulnerabilities found include: 
	1	The multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation.
	2	Enforce strong passwords.
	3	Initiate regulatory firewall maintenance.

With the MFA the users must use more than one way to identify and verify their credentials before obtaining access to the agency’s inner information. These include scanning the fingerprints of the user, ID cards, pins, and passwords. 

Password policies could request password length, a list of acceptable characters, in addition to avoid password sharing. 

The regular firewall maintenance focuses on checking and updating security configurations to stay avoid potential threats. 

## Part 2: Explain your recommendation(s)

When the organization implements the multi-factor authentication (MFA) it enforces an additional layer of security that goes beyond a password reducing  the possible access of a malicious actor into a network through a brute force or related attack. Additionally reduces the chance of employees sharing passwords, as for instance the one sharing the password would need to go through additional authentication besides a password, hence making passwords less likely to be shared.

When the organization enforces a password policy within it becomes challenging for malicious actors to access the network. Example policies such as suspending the account after a certain number of logins, increasing password complexity, requiring password updates, and reducing sharing passwords also helps malicious attackers from accessing the network. 

Administrators should ensure that firewall rules are regularly maintained and in place in up to date standards for allowed and denied traffic per the organization’s policies and these firewall rules should be updated whenever a security event occurs, to protect against any DoS and DDoS attacks.
